Aim: To find DC operating point find gain using transient analysis and AC analysis.
Components:Mosfet, resistor, dc power supply.
Procedure :
Make the circuit connection as given above.
connect the RD resistor to the drain terminal and dc power supply to the gate terminal and also to the resitor
connect the source to ground 
set the input voltage to 0.6v and vdd to 1.8v.
using the formula of power p=vi
as we know the value of power=50uW and voltage=1.8v
we get current=27uA
by adjusting the value of width and length of the mosfet we will get the current Id 
As length is given 180nm by adjusting we will get width=1.08um
